⚠️ Be sure to install the official [WordPress GraphQL plugin](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) before to continue. If you're stuck, please refer to [this guide](https://help.weweb.io/en/articles/5139437-how-to-connect-to-wordpress).

- Enter your WordPress site URL
- If you've changed your admin URL and the GraphQL endpoint of the plugin, change the values here. Most of the time, the default values will work as is.
